# Vision Transformer (ViT) on CIFAR-10

This tutorial demonstrates how to train a Vision Transformer (SimpleViT) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. It includes:
- Custom training loop
- Accuracy tracking and visualization
- Sample predictions
- Visualization of model architecture

## Files
- `vit_cifar10.ipynb`: Main training notebook
- `images/`: Visualizations (accuracy, predictions, model structure)
- `requirements.txt`: Package dependencies

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
